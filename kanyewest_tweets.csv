I love this new A$AP FERG album!!!
I also wanted to point out that it’s the first album to go number 1 off of streaming!!!
I’m so happy that you guys like the music…  I’m working on the tour designs now…
Thank you to everybody who made The Life of Pablo the number 1 album in the world!!!
Tribe changed music forever
His mother’s poem at the celebration brought me to tears.
All respect prayers and love to Phife’s family    Thank you for so much inspiration
hey guys do you like the fixed version of Wolves better?

Royère doesn't make a Polar bear bed but the Polar bear couch is my favorite piece of furniture we own https://t.co/tSJgikAUmT
and also my number one design rule of anything I do from shoes to music to homes is that Kim has to like it....
plus when you sit on the platform your calf is sort of half on half off
I love Rick Owens’ bed design but the back is too high for the beams and angle of the ceiling
I've been trying to figure out the bed design for the master bedroom at our Hidden Hills compound... https://t.co/aEPqoBGY4b

And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
We still love Kanye
That’s all it was Kanye
Man that'd be so Kanye
Called I Miss the Old Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
I even had the pink polo I thought I was Kanye
I  used to love Kanye
I used to love Kanye
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Kanyes
It wasn’t any Kanyes
See I invented Kanye
I gotta say at that time I’d like to meet Kanye
Chop up the beats Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye
Spaz in the news Kanye
The always rude Kanye
The bad mood Kanye
I hate the new Kanye
Set on his goals Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye
Straight from the Go Kanye
I miss the old Kanye

Happy Easter!
Young Thug is super inspiring to me. Amazing artist!!! https://t.co/tMh438xqJ8
I used an exclamation just to be an asshole and also to make a point! LOL
And I used a period because contrary to popular belief I strongly dislike exclamation points!
On another note I strongly dislike suit jackets. I used the word dislike because I hate the word hate.
I love you.
I have so much love in my heart and we just need the shot to create live breathe.
I love you guys.
Everyone has made mistakes. I just make them in public.
Don't hide from the truth because it is the only light.
Don't be mad at the truth. When you don't like me you are merely shooting the messenger.
Don't be scared of the truth because we need to restart the human foundation in truth
They think we're stupid. They do not know how to communicate.
When companies doubt me they doubt us.
That dreams will actualize. Dreams will manifest.
I have a dream.
Eventually the guys with real ideas not running a scam on the world will overcome.
They can't kill us all.
I speak yell scream directly at the old guard on behalf of the future.
The Pablo pop up was almost a pop up of influence.
We are here to make life better.
And I promise the power is in the people and I will use the power given by the people to bring everything I have back to the people.
I speak truth to power!!!
I represent the dreamers.
in the past the press/old guard and powers that be would have silenced me a long time ago but I have a form of social immunity.
thank God for paps thank God for social media
We will find freedom in truth as opposed to ridicule.
We no longer have to be scared of the truth
We will breathe clean air and exercise the first amendment.
We will not get bullied by perception any longer. We will give our opinions.
We will change that. We will rise.  We will have a voice.
In Roman times the artist would contemplate proportions and colors. Now there is only one important color... Green
Let's fight for our future. We can change everything.
I stand with the utmost humility. We are so blessed!!! All praises and blessings to the families of people who never gave up on dreams
I promise I will never let the people down. I want a better life for all!!! Pablo Pablo Pablo Pablo!
This is the people the culture the dreams the future.
but there is no other brand that could sell 1 million dollars of clothing in 2 days from 1 location!!!
they called me crazy and pointed fingers
Pablo in blood.
every red print is our blood our debt our shame our struggle our pain our heart ache.
Pablo in blood

My whole family loves you and your family and we appreciate the moment you helped realize on the Beams!!!
I love you. My dad loves you.
Thank you Kirk for standing by me through all the noise.
The choir arrangement that Kirk orchestrated is the most powerful thing I've heard in my earthly existence.
A lot of people tell me Ultralight Beam is my greatest artwork to date only rival being Jesus Walks.
Be strong today little bro!  “Come to me all of you who are tired and have heavy loads and I will give you rest. MATTHEW 11:28”
I just received a blessing from minister Kirk Franklin
Olivier designed clothes for my show… That was real   that was groundbreaking  that is a Real Friend.
Be real…
Don’t try to use me for advertisement or to make your proposed trend relevant.
If you wouldn’t invite me to your house then don’t invite me to your show.
Fake Fake Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake … just my analysis
So many people turned on her when she was fired and acted like they forgot the innovation and beauty that she brought to the world…
The fashion world is sooooooo fake and Carine is one of the very few real people in fashion…
I like T-shirts and women in yoga pants… I live in LA that’s what people wear… not sure why someone would put a suit jacket on with that.
All these journalists can give their opinions well these are mine…yes I believe in my ripped homeless sweaters!!!
Sorry I couldn’t be at Virgil’s show because I had a meeting in another city.
this is my friend and we've bounced ideas and references for years since the time when he designed for YEEZY Season 1.
I thank Demna for using the I feel like Pablo sweatshirts in his show
I thank Olivier for designing his collection around my wife… this is visionary as I believe that Kim is our modern day everything.
Oh and I only came to Paris fashion to stand by my friends Olivier Riccardo and Demna.
Just cause somebody is wearing combat boots doesn’t mean it’s all of a sudden youth.
I also hate all the stylists that copy Hedi Slimane and give their clients blatant YSL looks thinking that it will bring a younger client.
I feel we are so stuck in the past and tradition.
I especially hate suit jackets on women… that was a groundbreaking idea 5 million years ago!
I don’t personally like suit jackets anymore.
excited to see my family and finish the final mixes of the Life of Pablo and keep working on Turbo Grafx 16 and Season 4 ….
I’m on a plane coming back from Europe…
Get Top on the phoooone!!!!!  @Kendricklamar
we win
the pure of heart win…
the thinkers win…
the artists win...
the future thinkers win…
Together we stand… we win…
Thank you to @asvpxrocky for supporting me at the MSG show…
I guess in a media world where you never hear the truth the truth can come off as crazy…
It’s been a lot of confusion in the past 3 weeks so let me apologize for in any way being confusing…
. @Adidas is making a million Yeezys this year opening up new factories…
Feeling like Robin Hood…
what war?  a class war… a war against time…
sometimes the quiet moments feel like I’m home from battle…
can’t wait to get home to North Saint and my wife…
Met with @Hermes_Paris family yesterday… been out here fighting for 13 years and it feels like we’re finally seeing wins…
Was speaking with @souljaian earlier about a new idea…
So proud of my brother @VirgilAbloh with his new @OffWht collection!!!
bear with me guys Rome wasn’t built in a day but I promise to keep my promises…
really happy to get the quality of the products better at half the prices of last year…
Sitting with @Robinnowicki from @ustwo working on the YEEZY site…
playing the new Kendrick…  1 thousand images on the desktop…  Hennessy &amp; what’s left of the ice and coke zero…
Super inspired by my visit to Ikea today  really amazing company… my mind is racing with the possibilities…
Up late designing in Sweden…
please see these next tweets as such because the ideas will jump around a bit… a bit like a mood board...
this is a stream of consciousness… twitter poetry…
Thank you Carine for believing in the vision You are a visionary https://t.co/f13xrRC5W9

please avoid trying to talk me out of being me in the future
Growing and learning but not being told to stop ...not being stunted.
I want people to be the best version of themselves and I will be the best version of me.
question... Why do people not want me to be me?
uuuuuuum so there it is... No more CDs from me
the Yeezus album packaging was an open casket to CDs r.i.p
I was thinking about not making CDs ever again... Only streaming
Uuuuum... hi everybody!

I want to stream you performing in a Minnie Mouse head on @TIDALHiFi
I’m very detailed oriented and I will know the difference so don’t try to just throw a bow on the original head…
I need you to perform at her party with specifically a minnie mouse dead-mow-five head… not a mickey mouse dead-mow-five head.
can you please bring the minnie mouse head … not yours   she specifically likes minnie mouse …
Do you do birthday parties?? My daughter loves Minnie mouse…
# I’m bored  ### when you get married will your wife have a giant minnie mouse head? # This brightened up my day… thank you dead-mow-five
# hash tag you raised Tidal’s subscriptions by a whopping 🐭🐭🐭downloads
# ok another super serious question   ...  is there a portable fan situation?
# whose job is it to carry the head on the plane # hash tag #  do you check the mickey mouse head or carry on #  does it get  hot?
# ok very serious question…
@Deadmau5 … is this person’s name pronounced dead-mow-five?

Finally!!! Our guy!!! We're so so happy for Leo!!!
It is so inspiring.  Thank you for existing!
and also let’s shout out to the art direction … candy on the screens!
I just want to thank Will Ferrell for the years of joy he has brought into my life with amazing comedy
We all know Will Ferrell has always been the one!!!
that showed how sharp and Bruce Lee status he is.
Perhaps it was seeing him play the same character from 15 years ago with 15 more years experience
His existence is a blessing.
Will Ferrell has reached walking living breathing god status!
I saw Zoolander 2 for the 2nd time
correction the name of the Neo Geo game I was referring to was The Super Spy
We actually played Spy Hunter at my mom’s house!!!
My boy Mali that I spoke about on the song Drive Slow actually had a Neo Geo in real life bro…
Blazing Lazers was probably my favorite game on that console …
just on some super nerd vibes… one of my favorite gaming systems when I was a kid…
My next album is titled   Turbo Grafx 16   as of now…
This best explains my experience in fashion and with fashion people in general   https://t.co/rY7o51TDss

Kirk Franklin just sent me a blessing. I needed that. Thank you minister.
There are some lame fake accounts trying to make Kanye-isms that are not Mark Twain level.
Hi @Jack Dorsey can you guys please take down all the fake Kanye accounts.
I'm not a rapper.
I just thought of the craziest idea of all ... I'm going to sell winter coats in the winter!!!
I'm going to steal Demna from Balenciaga
You won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me. I'm woke!
The world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth.
I love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up.
I represent what people can't say.
New album coming this summer
I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now.
And yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes.
That is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much.
Respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids
What is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom.
I just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice.
You guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference.
It's a beautiful time.  I love my friends. I love my family.  I love people. The human race.
Free from being held back by public opinion.
I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But I'm not ashamed anymore.
No slave mindset no more. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.
I'm not crazy I'm free.
People ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams.
We need to see Young Thug at the Grammys.  Not just me and Jay in a suit.
First order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys.
and always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis 😭😭😭 all positive vibes.
Us real music guys wanna have fun too
Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again.
All artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now.
Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys.
You like your black people a certain way also. You wouldn't have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer.
You guys are supposed to be all about taste.
Dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right!!!
Everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year!
I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rocky’s LSD video.
If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show.
Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel.
We need to fix this.
I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine.
I think the Grammys are super important!!!
I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now
I really didn’t mean to use the B word tonight    …  all positive vibes
God bless the fools … all positive vibes!
Ezrin I truly feel sorry for your friends and family that they have had to suffer an idiot like you for so many years…
Welcome to pop culture!!!
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn’t nominated for either and you know who has 2 albums of the year.
Rock and Roll was stolen… Rap was exploited…
it’s guys like you that run companies and don’t invest in Ye even if I’m your kid’s idol!!!
Bob please never speak in public again… you are everything that is wrong with the old guard …
Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me… no offense to Macklemore he’s a nice human being!
I’m so sorry for them…   I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family!
Your kids are ashamed of their dad…  Sorry for speaking about kids…  but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrin’s kids…
Do something relevant… Please don’t speak on me bro ever again!!!
I’m tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music!
What the fuck does he know about rap…
Has anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???
If you are an entrepreneur you may have debt and lawsuits #facts

Drake would come by and just help no strings. Future also came by to write. We all got new shit together that's gonna drop soon.
I wanna thank my brother Drizzy for helping me on 30 Hours &amp; Father Stretch My Hands.
Season 4 begins. Première Vision https://t.co/LAlvRnlUgG
My number one enemy has been my ego…  there is only one throne and that’s God's  …
In rap we have been developing a brotherhood…
There is so much positive energy right now …  Let’s stay on this Ultra Light Beam…
A wise man should be humble enough to admit when he’s wrong and change his mind based on new information…
Some rappers got the club … Some got the radio… some got the conscience…some got the streets… Everybody has something they do the best…
every rapper is somebody’s favorite…
that statement has’t been sitting well with me… That’s a dated mentality   ... I’m not on that …
Man I was thinking about when I commented on the idea of taking the rap throne” …
Just creating in a fun simple way with no politics…
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school…
all with one purpose of creating  beautiful product that can be attainable by everyone…
A dream of mine would be to do a project where I  work side by side with Raf Simmons  Helmut Lang Vanessa Beecroft and Martin Margiela

Hey Nicolas Ghesquiere I grew up on Tron too… Let’s be best friends!!!
I’d rather teachers got paid more and books cost less … #2020
We have to lower the price of textbooks…
Education puts Americans into debt before they even get a chance to get started…
Steve Jobs wanted to lower the cost of textbooks…
she’s giving everything she has to make sure her son has a better future…
I mean his mom has to work 2 days just to afford 1 book for her son …
Her son just got in a really good school and his textbooks are like $400 dollars each …
I have a friend who works really hard and makes $370 dollars a day…
All positive energy
so many people were inspired  and that’s all I wanted…
MSG was amazing …
You let me dream without limits….
They provided resources for me to create… they supported me …  I thank you so so much  …
Adidas has really made all the difference …
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision …
Pablo is full of joy and love because I was able to create….
I hope these words and this moment of truth can serve as some extra motivation to you…
for anybody listening to Pablo now working on a dream
so people laughed when I said I wanted to be able to take care of my family …
but if you don’t have your paper right there's a chance that your family can be broken up
when Sway was telling me what to do I was in debt and had a child…
When Charlemagne was calling me donkey of the day I was in debt
I can see the clouds separating …
I’m  an artist…  the definition of art - or at least my definition - is to be able to see the truth and then express it...
I don’t have to be cool…
perhaps a fashion group will cover the 53 that I’ve invested over the past 13 years…
Perhaps Adidas will do some big Lebron style deal or  …
my dreams brought me into debt and I’m close to seeing the light of day…
this country was built off of dreamers …   never give up on your dreams bro…
You can point fingers and laugh but for all entrepreneurs with families  ...
I wanted the world to know my struggle…
Money doesn’t make me who I am…
You can’t control me or use the debt against me no more   …
For the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations …
only problem I got with Good Fridays is I got more songs than I got old pictures!!!! Lol!!!!
Also all Good Fridays songs will be on Tidal. Me and Kendrick got 40 songs and me and Young Thug got 40 songs. 40/40 club!!!
Please to all my friends fans and music lovers. Sign up to Tidal now.
My album will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale... You can only get it on Tidal.
This was made with love. Only God can judge me. So I only expect love back!!!
Shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.
Aight then …
Don't tell me Lebron had a bad game. What yo jump shot look like???
The system is designed for colored people to fail and one of our only voices is music. One of our only ways out is music.
I love love love white people but you don't understand what it means to be the great grandson of ex slaves and make it this far.
To Pitchfork Rolling Stone New York Times and any other white publication. Please do not comment on black music anymore.
Puff Daddy is the most important cultural figure in my life. His influence means everything to me.
Pitchfork the album is a 30 out of 10
People wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!
and a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators
No matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle
but if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart.
This is a God dream
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more.
and I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is.
There are people who support artist and philanthropist
I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you.
Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money.
If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up.
but I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world.
Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family
I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity.
I just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties.
...on another note can brah be the girl verson of bruh???
and yes there are misspellings on this chart… that’s how you know it’s me...
All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help….
I promise I’m going to make the world dope…. all I do is make shit dope #facts…
if you want to help… help me…
you’d rather open up one school in Africa like you really helped the country…
All you dudes in San Fran play rap music in your homes    but never help the real artists…
hey Larry Page I’m down for your help too …
Here is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at… https://t.co/g1po6Z3H55
I know I can make the world a better place… I have done the impossible … I retook the throne of rap… I beat the fashion game…
and I will always respect you for that and the world will love you…
one of the coolest things you could ever do is to help me in my time of need
Mark I am publicly asking you for help…
I don’t have enough resources to create what I really can…
I’m this generation's Disney… I want to bring dope shit to the world…
World please tweet FaceTime Facebook instagram whatever you gotta do to get Mark to support me…
You love hip hop you love my art… I am your favorite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house …
Mark Zuckerberg  I know it’s your bday but can you please call me by 2mrw…
I put Lowlights on my album just thinking about all the moms driving they kids to school then going to work…
Bars are worth more than money because it's something the people can use everyday to feel inspired.
I know y'all tired of music controlled by money and perception.  I'm proud of every dime of debt I got.
All y'all so worried about being likable but only a few are concerned about being great!!!
I am the Jordan and Steph Curry of music meaning I'm the best of 2 generations.
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ... I will have over 100 Grammys before I die.
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ...

Let's dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world.
All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up...
Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins...
He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship... I have the right to speak my voice...
He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...
Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...

I’ve given everything I had for this moment… a lot of people feel it’s the paradigm shift …
fashion ain’t no joke for me… It’s a way of life… creative expression and industry…
so many people didn’t make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion…
Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far… you have no idea what I’ve had to go through …
I’m a human being… I’m an artist bro…
you probably got bootleg Yeezy’s on right now…
but Media Takeout couldn’t say one thing positive knowing damn well you’d love to be on the YEEZY 350 list…
people were crying… people were throwing up the fist… people were dancing…
I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden…
respect the struggle… respect the hustle… respect the dreams…  respect the movement…
You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down… when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it…
Now - Media Takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world.
It’s Chance's fault the album not out yet… he really wanted Waves on that Bitch…  we in the lab now...
There would be no MSG without @iamdiddy my OG. He fought this war 15 years ago. Respect OG.

I want to be the creative director of Hermes…
not just the famous people there    but the kids   the moms the dads  the families that came to share this moment with us
9th   It felt like a seen from The Warriors     ALL GODS   ALL GODS ALL GODS in the buildin
but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us
8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
7th  I miss that feeling  so that’s what I want to help restore
That’s why music is so fucking watered down right now    I miss that DMX feeling
6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art
I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  #FACTS
She was having dinner with one of our friends who’s name I will keep out of this and she told him
5th  thing I’m not even gone take credit for the idea… it’s actually something Taylor came up with …
4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga
3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
2nd thing   I asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it
First thing is I’m an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
I did not diss Taylor Swift and I’ve never dissed her…

On February 11th these dreams come true
It was always a dream to show my collection at Madison Square Garden
It was always a dream to have a listening party at Madison Square Garden
Aye Billboard you could use the term “unauthorized but never refer to anything that me and Tyler do as fake out of respect to musicians…
@billboard … it’s not a fake cover… you seen it didn’t you… you know we shot it didn’t you…
Should this be a Rolling Stone cover?  Yes or No
I bet you this still becomes the cover though... Let's do another poll.....

ROLLING STONE SHOT BY TYLER THE CREATOR https://t.co/lOMtOdOEel

CONGRATULATIONS TO MY BROTHER VIRGIL ABLOH ON THE NEW BORN
God’s dream…   Never speak on kids again…   all love … all blessings…
I’m not into that kind of shit…  I like pictures and videos     Me and my wife got the kind of love that can turn exes into best friends
Exes can be mad but just know   I never let them play with my ass…    I don’t do that… I stay away from that area all together
I’m happy that I now know that KK means weed…  please excuse the confusion …  now back to #WAVES
Man it’s a sad a day… Wiz lost 2 million followers since I tweeted      I didn’t mean to either him like that.
In the lab with Ian Connor by the way
The Devil can’t stop us
Ima take these down cause it’s all about positive energy    blessings  blessings    positive energy blessings
Good energy  positive energy
This album is actually a Gospel album
I love the world bottom line and all I want is peace and positive energy
What’s sad is I love Wiz and I love all all my brothers and all people

I pray for his friends and family.
David Bowie was one of my most important inspirations so fearless so creative he gave us magic for a lifetime.
I have no interest in working with anyone who is too important or too good or too traditional to take a call at 3am
My idol. https://t.co/YGFrPhQmDP

I hope you have a nice weekend.
New version is up.  Please please erase the old one I wasn’t satisfied with the sound quality.
It will be back up shortly.  When it’s back up all rippers please rip the new one instead.
Un momento there was a slight distortion in the main loop within Real Friends.
Thank you GQ and to everyone who voted it’s been an amazing year!!!
